\chapter{User classes and usability requirements}

\section{User classes}

\subsection{Physical characteristics}

\begin{description}
\item[Age:] 18 - 67. This is why we will use large fonts, big buttons, clear colors to provide a way of letting the users know in one instance what they are looking at and if their action has been successfully completed.
\item[Sex:] Both men and women will use the tool.
\item[Vision limitation:] A little light on top of the door will be used to indicate if something went wrong while performing one action. The reasoning behind this is that the light will draw the attention of the user. If nothing went wrong, there is no need to draw the attention of the user, thus the light will not be lit.
\end{description}

\subsection{Cultural differences}

Due to the fact that this tool will be used in an university, a lot of different cultures will get in touch with this tool. That is why everything will be implemented in English. Everyone has some basic knowledge of the English language and even if they don't, the tool will be simple and intuitive enough so that users are able to perform each action without difficulties. 

\subsection{Education}

We can assume that everyone who studies / works at the university has had a minimal amount of education. This should not be a big issue here.

\subsection{Knowledge of task}

The tool will daily be used by students, assistants, professors and other people. It will make the life of the users easier and at one glance one will be able to make appointments and even see if one has appointments assigned to them by others. (if one is a professor or assistant). The use of special vocabulary will not be used because we will implement the system in a very simple way. The less you need to read, the faster you will be able to perform the action.

\subsection{Computer experience}

This will be used by the WISE members / students of the VUB. We can thus assume that every user has a basic computer knowledge. That is why we are putting the users in the `competent performer' category.


\subsection{User classes}

\textbf{Primary user}
\begin{itemize}
\item Type of user: direct
\item Level of task knowledge: high
\item Frequency of use: frequent  
\item Existing computer skills: high 
\item Other systems that will be used concurrently:
\item Motivation for using system: appointments can be made with this type of user and this type of user can also make appointments.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Secondary user}
\begin{itemize}
\item Type of user: direct
\item  Level of task knowledge: high
\item Frequency of use: frequent
\item Existing computer skills: high 
\item Other systems that will be used concurrently:
\item Motivation for using system: appointments can be made with this type of user and this type of user can also make appointments. 
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Others}
\begin{itemize}
\item Type of user: direct
\item Level of task knowledge: high 
\item Frequency of use: frequent 
\item Existing computer skills: depends on the user, some users can have much experience, while others donâ€™t.
\item Other systems that will be used concurrently: 
\item Motivation for using system: this type of user can only make appointments.
\end{itemize}
